1. Schedule is top priority
    Google form to spreadsheet with columns to help track workshop information
    
    After workshops are collected, it gets exported into excel and then into schedge.org
    
    schedge.org generates the pdf's
    (possibly pull schedules from that site?)

2. Emphasis on the teacher (promote first year teachers) Have a "meet the teachers" page

    Way for teachers to have more exposure. Name, bio, photos so people can see more about them

3. Challenge: How can we make breathe bigger? More than just one week a year, what can we do to increase the longevity. 

4. Food sharing/Popups is a cooool thing. 
    Ability for live interaction like dropping pins for activities going on in the present.

    Could this make people more invested in their phones? potentially not great

    Maybe have prefrences so you only get notified when something youre interested in is happening

5. Giving back to breathe 100%

6. Ticketing platform: Spark
    Having trouble quantifying audience and keeping track of contacts

    Keep a database of people who have bought tickets, make the check in process easier
